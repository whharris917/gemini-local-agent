Once upon a time, in a cozy little burrow, lived a small rabbit named Pip. Pip loved to gaze at the moon before he slept. Tonight, the moon was a bright, silver sliver in the dark, velvety sky.

'Goodnight, Moon,' he whispered from his window.

A tiny star twinkled back at him. 'Goodnight, Pip,' it seemed to say. 'May your dreams be as sweet as the carrots in your garden.'

Pip yawned, feeling warm and safe. He snuggled into his soft, leafy bed. He dreamt of hopping through fields of glowing moonflowers and chasing giggling stars until the sun peeked over the hills. And in his dream, the moon watched over him, smiling.
